# How-to-rotate-winforms-carousel-programmatically
This example demonstrates how to rotate the WinForms Carousel control programmatically using Syncfusion's Windows Forms UI components. The Carousel control is a visually engaging way to display a collection of items in a circular or elliptical layout, often used in dashboards, galleries, or product showcases.
In many real-world applications, developers may want to control the rotation of the carousel manually. This could include rotating to a specific item based on user input, rotating continuously for a slideshow effect, or rotating in response to a timer or event. This sample project shows how to implement such functionality using straightforward C# code.
## Key Features Demonstrated:
- Initializing the Carousel control with a custom collection of items.
- Automating rotation using a Timer control to create a smooth, hands-free carousel experience.
- Customizing the rotation behavior, speed, and direction to suit different UI needs.
- Enhancing user experience by providing intuitive navigation and dynamic content presentation.
This example is ideal for developers looking to add interactive, animated UI elements to their WinForms applications.
